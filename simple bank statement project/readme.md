Project Title: Simple Bank Statement Generator

Description:
Create a Python program that generates a simple bank statement for a user. The program should allow the user to input their account details such as account number, initial balance, and transaction history (e.g., deposits, withdrawals). Based on this information, the program will calculate the current balance and display a formatted bank statement showing transaction details and the updated balance after each transaction.

Features:

1.Input account details: Account number, initial balance.
2.Record transactions: Deposits and withdrawals with dates and amounts.
3.Calculate current balance: Update the balance after each transaction.
4.Generate bank statement: Display transaction history and updated balance.

Implementation:
•Use Python data structures like dictionaries or lists to store account information and transaction history.
•Implement functions for depositing, withdrawing, and generating the bank statement.
•Format the bank statement output for readability and clarity.

Additional Ideas (Optional):
•Add a feature to save the bank statement to a text file for future reference.
•Implement basic error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs for amounts).
